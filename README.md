# Snap2Reality
Snap2Reality (S2R) uses AI to analyze pictures captured or uploaded by users, storing them in an online inventory and providing project ideas. The AI generates detailed project suggestions, offering users creative ways to repurpose their spare items.

## Key Features
- Recognising objects, using GROQ's open AI model we analyze the image given to recognize the different objects in an image that are relevant to the task, for example if an image of a raspberry pi and its components is given GROQ's model would recognize and return the object shown like the breadboard, LED lights, etc.
- Positioning objects, moreover using the same model we can get the coordinates of each object, in the future, this can help us implement something where we can annotate the picture a certain way, possibly with the required parts to build the proposed project.
- Providing ideas, the AI model has been fine-tuned with precise system instructions to give multiple ideas that are all fun to make!
